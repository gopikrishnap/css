        <h1 class="s3">Childhood & Early Life</h1>
        <p class="p3">He was born as Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam on 15 October 1931 into a Muslim family in Rameswaram, then in
            the Madras Presidency in British India, and now in the state of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabudeen was a boat
            owner while his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. Kalam had four elder siblings. Even though his ancestors had
            been wealthy traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time
            Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family’s meager income. Even
            though the family was not financially well-off, the children were raised in an atmosphere filled with love. In
            one of the books which Kalam wrote decades later, he fondly remembered how his mother would lovingly feed her
            own quota of food to the children and go hungry herself. He was a good student and always curious to learn more
            about how things happened. When he was ten years old, one of his teachers, Siva Subramania Iyer, took the students
            to the seashore and asked them to observe the birds in flight. Then the teacher gave the children a theoretical
            explanation, which coupled with the live practical example, cast a deep influence on young Kalam’s mind. That
            very day the boy realized that his life’s calling had something to do with flight. After completing his studies
            at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, he enrolled at Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, graduating in science
            in 1954. Pursuing his childhood dream, he travelled to Madras to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute
            of Technology. During his third year, he was assigned a project to design a low-level attack aircraft together
            with a few other students. The project was a difficult one and on top of it, their guide gave them a very tight
            deadline. The young men toiled together, working under immense pressure, and finally managed to achieve the target
            within the stipulated deadline. The guide was thoroughly impressed by Kalam’s dedication. At this juncture, Kalam
            aspired to become a fighter pilot. However he could not realize this dream.</p>

        <h1 class="s4">Career As A Scientist</h1>
        <p class="p4">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam earned his degree from Madras Institute of Technology in 1957 and joined the Aeronautical Development
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist in 1958. In the early
            1960s, he worked with the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) under the renowned space scientist
            Vikram Sarabhai. He also designed a small hovercraft at DRDO. He visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton,
            Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility in 1963-64. Inspired
            by this visit, he began working on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. However, he was
            not much satisfied with his work at DRDO and was happy to be transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) in 1969. There he served as the project director of the SLV-III, India’s first indigenously designed and
            produced satellite launch vehicle. In the 1970s, he began making efforts to develop the Polar Satellite Launch
            Vehicle (PSLV). Developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into Sun-synchronous
            orbits, the nation’s PSLV project was an eventual success; it was first launched on 20 September 1993. A.P.J.
            Kalam also directed several other projects, including Project Devil, in the 1970s. Project Devil was an early
            liquid-fueled missile project aimed at producing a short-range surface-to-air missile. The project was not a
            success in the long-term and was discontinued in the 1980s. However it led to the later development of the Prithvi
            missile in the 1980s.</p>

        <h1 class="s5">Tenure As President of India</h1>
        <p class="p5">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam assumed office as the 11th President of India on 25 July 2002, becoming the first scientist and
            the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan. Over the course of his five-year term, he remained committed
            to his vision of transforming India into a developed nation and thus spent a lot of time conducting one-on-one
            meetings with young people to inspire them to achieve their best. He proved to be very popular with the citizens
            of the country and became known as the “People’s President.’ He was however criticized for not taking any concrete
            actions on the mercy petitions of convicts on death row submitted to him during his tenure. Out of the 21 mercy
            petitions submitted to him, he acted on only one plea in his five-year tenure. In 2007, he decided not to contest
            the Presidential election again and stepped down as the President on 25 July 2007.</p>

        <h1 class="s6">Personal Life & Legacye</h1>
        <p class="p6">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was the youngest child in a close knit family. He was very close to his parents, especially his
            mother, and had loving relationships with all of his four elder siblings. He never married. Throughout his life
            he maintained close ties with his siblings and their extended families. A benevolent soul, he often sent money
            to his elderly relatives. He was a very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He owned a few possessions—including
            his beloved veena and collection of books. He didn’t even have a television! A kind hearted man, he was a vegetarian
            and consumed simple food. A devout Muslim, he had been raised with strict Islamic customs. He respected all religions
            and was well-versed in Hindu traditions in addition to his Islamic practices. He not only read the namaz daily
            and fasted during Ramadan, but also regularly read the Bhagavad Gita.</p>


        <hr>
        <h1 class="s7">Post Presidenc</h1>
        <p class="p7">A.P.J Abdul Kalam ventured into the academic field after leaving office. He became a visiting professor at several
            reputed institutions including the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management
            Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Interacting with bright young minds was what he loved
            the most and he devoted the later years of his career to this passion. The post presidency years also saw him
            teaching information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology
            at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University. He also served as the chancellor of the Indian Institute of
            Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram. In 2012, he launched a programme called 'What Can I Give Movement’
            to develop a “giving” attitude in the youth and to encourage them to contribute towards nation building by taking
            small but positive steps.</p>
