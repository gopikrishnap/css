        <p class="P1">On 13 September 2007, the BCCI announced the launch of a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian
            Premier League whose first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi.
            BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, said to be the mastermind behind the idea of IPL, spelled out the details of
            the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It
            was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players
            and BCCI officials, and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20.
            Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk
            reaction" to the ICL. The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League of England and the NBA in
            the United States.</p>



        <p>Currently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away round-robin format in the league
            phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams
            from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight
            to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying
            match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator
            match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second
            Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match,
            where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.</p>
